# The challenge

As data analysts, we produce a lot of files

* code 
* figures 
* tables 
* reports 

Organising these files is an important, albeit often unglamorous, part of our job.  

--

*** 

**Managing versions** What do you do with old code? 

**Ensuring reproducibility** Can others reproduce your results? What about your future self? 

**Facilitating collaboration** Can other team members easily contribute?

# 🚲 The old school solution

The old school solution combines many practical strategies:

* Using file naming conventions to track different file versions 

    * analysis-16jun20.do 
    * analysis-16jun20-mh.do 
    * analysis-final.do 
    * analysis-final-final.do

* Note changes directly in code comments or separate documentation

* Use shared folders, google drive etc 

* Share code and code snippets over email, slack etc

*** 
This is ok(ish) for one person working on a small, brief project.

But if the project is **large**, involves **many people** or goes on for a **long time** this approach very quickly breaks down 😟

# 🚀 The new school solution

The new school solution is to use dedicated **version control software**. 

There are a few options out there but by far the most popular choice is the combination of **Git** + **GitHub** <svg aria-hidden="true" role="img" viewBox="0 0 496 512" style="height:1em;width:0.97em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;"><path d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"/></svg>.

# Key concept: Repository 

.pull-left[

![](images/repo-example.png)

]

.pull-right[

### A repository is where the magic happens 🧙‍♂️

* Referred to as a repo 
* Database of changes to your code (aka _diffs_)
* Hidden folder on your system named **.git**

Once you initialise a git repo in a folder, git is ready to start tracking changes to all the files and subfolders therein. 

]



---
class: left, top

# Key concept: Commit 

.pull-left[

![](images/commit-diagram.png)

]

.pull-right[

### Commit

* A Commit is like clicking save in a MS Word document 

* It saves a snapshot of the code at that point in time 

* Why you commit you must write a message explaining what changed

* Committing is a two stage process - more on this later

]


---
class: left, top

# Key concept: Diff 

.pull-left[

![](images/commit-example.png)

]

.pull-right[

### Diff

* A diff is the set of changes between two versions of a file 

* When you commit, it is the _diff_ that gets recorded, not the whole version

* The screenshot highlights a single diff: deletion of the word "clinic"

# Frequently asked questions

# Frequently asked questions 

### What files can I track? 

***

--

This all works best for non-binary or text files e.g. your typical code files (.sas, .do, .R, .Rmd, .py) but also .png, .csv etc

You can include non-binary files (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx etc) in a git repo but the diff features won't work. It can still be useful if using the repo as a central orgnaisation point (e.g. if you save your published manuscript with the analysis code). 


---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

### How often should I commit? 

***

--

Well, it depends.

Just like when you start writing a word document you might not click save very often as you spew out lots of ideas, but at the end of your thesis you will carefully save evey change! 

It is best practice to keep commits fairly small and related, especially for mature projects. 


---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

### What's with the staging area? 

***

--

There are advantages of breaking up the commit into two steps 

* You can split a big edit into bite-sized pieces 

* Easier to review

* If you make a mistake you can _unstage_. You can't un-commit!


---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

### What about my sensitive data/code? 

***

--

If your data are sensitive be very careful not to track with Git (more tips on this later). 

Private repos are available if you don't want the public to see your code (you can change to public later if desired.)

---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

### How does my repo align with my project folder?

***

--

Just like when you create project folders and sub-folders you need to put some thought into how to organise your repos.

One option is to initiate the repo in the root folder of the project, meaning that all files and subfolders are tracked by default. 

An alternative would be to initiate the repo in a specific folder, e.g. your `Code` folder, and keep your data in a separate `Data` folder.

In either approach you can specify any files or folders that Git should ignore in a special file named `.gitignore`.

#### Notes on exercises

* These are not hard but can be... _fiddly_. Don't panic if you get lost. You can always watch the demo and come back to it afterwards.  

* At this stage, if something goes wrong it can be easiest to close the shell and start again.

#### Tips for Success

* **Enter the commands carefully!** **A** versus **a** or **-** versus **--** will make a difference! 

* **Pay attention to any messages** git returns. They're often incomprehensible but should flag if something has gone wrong 

* You can launch Git Bash/Terminal from your file browser by clicking on a folder and selecting **Git Bash Here** (in windows) or **New Terminal at Folder** (in macOS)

* Use &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git status&lt;/span&gt; often to confirm the current state of your repo 

* ↹ Use **tab** in Git Bash/Terminal to auto-complete file and folder names

* &amp;uarr; Use the up arrow in Git Bash/Terminal to retrieve the last command you entered 

* &amp;larr; &amp;rarr; Use the left and right arrows to position your cursor in Git Bash/Terminal (e.g.if you want to edit a typo in a command)

* `ctrl+V` doesn't work to paste into Git Bash, use **insert** or **Right Click -&gt; Edit -&gt; Paste**

# Exercise 1 of 7 🚗

#### Task: Practice using shell commands to create a new folder and empty text file with GitBash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)

.left-column[

#### Tips

Ctrl+V doesn’t work in GitBash, right-click and choose paste instead. 

&lt;span class=myCode&gt;cd ~&lt;/span&gt; is the home directory

&lt;span class=myCode&gt;cd ..&lt;/span&gt; moves you "up" one folder

]

.right-column[

1. Open GitBash/Terminal. Type &lt;span class=myCode&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt; to confirm the current folder 

1. Use the &lt;span class=myCode&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; command (change directory) to navigate to the location you want to create your new folder. e.g. &lt;span class=myCode&gt;cd ~/Documents&lt;/span&gt;

1. Use the `mkdir` command to create a new folder named GitDemo. Enter &lt;span class=myCode&gt;mkdir GitDemo&lt;/span&gt;

1. Use the `cd` command again to change directory to the new folder. Enter &lt;span class=myCode&gt; cd GitDemo&lt;/span&gt;

1. Use the `touch` command to create a new text file named method.txt. Enter &lt;span class=myCode&gt; touch method.txt&lt;/span&gt;

Can you see the new folder and file on your computer? 🎉

# Exercise 2 of 7 🚗

#### Task: Configure Git with your username and email

.left-column[

#### Tips 

In Git Bash and Terminal, use the up key &amp;uarr; to bring up the last command you entered

]

.right-column[

Using GitBash or Terminal, configure Git with your username and email by entering the commands below:

1. &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git config --global user.name "John Doe”&lt;/span&gt;

1. &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
&lt;/span&gt;

To check it has worked you can enter &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git config --list
&lt;/span&gt;.

Do you see your user name and email listed among your configuration settings? 🎉

# Exercise 3 of 7 🚗

#### Task: Initialise a git repo then add and commit changes to your text file

.left-column[

#### Tips

Enter &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git status&lt;/span&gt; after every step to check the current state of your repo!

We want to emulating writing real code so make sure to do the edit &amp;rarr; save &amp;rarr; add &amp;rarr; commit cycle a few times

]

.right-column[

1. Make sure you are in your new folder: &lt;span class=myCode&gt;cd GitDemo&lt;/span&gt;

1. Initialise a git repo: &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git init&lt;/span&gt;

1. Check the status of your repo: &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git status&lt;/span&gt;

1. Open method.txt with your preferred text editor &amp; write a short list or recipe. Save after adding each item click save and then:

    1. Stage the file: &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git add -A&lt;/span&gt;
    1. Commit the file: &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git commit -m “your message here”&lt;/span&gt;

1. Enter &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git log&lt;/span&gt; to view a log of your changes

Do you see a list of the commit messages you entered? 🎉

# Exercise 4 of 7 🚀

#### Task: Create an empty repo on GitHub and push your local repo to this empty GitHub repo 

.left-column[

#### Tips 

Remember, ctrl+c and ctrl+v wont work in the shell. You can use `insert` or right-click and choose paste. 

]

.right-column[

1. Log in at github.com and create a new public repo (use + button in top right-hand corner)

1. Give the GitHub repo the same name as your project folder.

1. Ignore the options to initialize a README, add a .gitignore or license

1. When you are ready select **Create Repository**

1. When you create the blank repo, three options will appear. Follow the instructions labelled **to push an existing repository from the command line**. Copy and run the three lines of code one-by-one into Git Bash/Terminal.  

Refresh the GitHub tab. Can you see your method.txt file history? 🎈

# Exercise 5 of 7 🚀

#### Task: Clone an existing GitHub repo to your local computer

.left-column[

#### Tips 

If your current working directory is GitDemo then 
&lt;span class=myCode&gt;cd ..&lt;/span&gt; will change your directory to the parent folder.

If you clone the new repo here then `GitDemo` and `getting-started-practice` will be side-by-side

]

.right-column[

1. Go to https://github.com/MarkHanly/getting-started-practice

1. Click on the &lt;span class="myButton"&gt;Code&lt;/span&gt; button and copy the HTTPS url to your clipboard.

1. Using GitBash/Terminal, use `cd` to navigate to a location you want to clone this practice repo. **Don’t clone it into the repo you created earlier!**

1. Enter &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git clone https://github.com/MarkHanly/getting-started-practice.git&lt;/span&gt; to clone the practice repo locally (this is the url you've just copied so you can paste it in)

Can you see the `getting-started-practice` folder copied locally? 🎈

# Exercise 6 of 7 🚀

#### Task: Create a new branch, add a new file and push your branch to GitHub

.left-column[

#### Tips
Replace `yourmame` with your actual name e.g. `mhanly`.

For the `push` to work you need to be added as a collaborator on the GitHub repo. If you haven't already, send me your GitHub username!

 
]

.right-column[

1. Navigate to the newly cloned repo: &lt;span class=myCode&gt;cd getting-started-practice&lt;/span&gt;
1. Create a new branch (name the branch with your name so that it is unique): &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git checkout -b _yourname_-branch&lt;/span&gt;
1. Add a new .txt file (name the file with your name so that it is unique): &lt;span class=myCode&gt;touch _yourname_-edits.txt&lt;/span&gt;
1. Open the new .txt file in the usual way, write a line or two and click save. 
1. Confirm you have edited the file: &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git status&lt;/span&gt;
1. Use &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git add -A&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git commit -m “message”&lt;/span&gt; as before to add and commit changes
1. Push your local changes to the GitHub repo &lt;span class=myCode&gt;git push --set-upstream origin _yourname_-branch&lt;/span&gt;

Can you see your branch listed under https://github.com/MarkHanly/getting-started-practice/branches ? 🎂

# Exercise 7 of 7 🌔

#### Task: Submit a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch on GitHub

.left-column[

#### Tips
To merge a branch on GitHub we submit a "pull request". This is different to `git pull` which pulls a remote repo to a local repo. 

 
]

.right-column[

1. Go to https://github.com/MarkHanly/getting-started-practice/branches

1. You should see you branch listed under active branches. Click &lt;span class="myButton"&gt;New pull request&lt;/span&gt;. 

1. Click &lt;span class="myButton"&gt;Create pull request&lt;/span&gt; 

1. You should see a note to say "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch". Click &lt;span class="myButton"&gt;Merge pull request&lt;/span&gt; and then &lt;span class="myButton"&gt;Confirm merge&lt;/span&gt;. 

Can you see your file listed under the main branch at https://github.com/MarkHanly/getting-started-practice? 🥳

Git and Github are powerful tools with numerous features. We have only scraped the surface, focussing on the simplest elements of an individual workflow but the real benefits come with collaboration.

*** 

Collaborating effectively requires additional steps that haven't been covered in these intro slides:

**branching** | spawn a new branch to develop new features

**merging** | combine separate branches back together

**pull requests** | request your feature branch to be integrated into the code base

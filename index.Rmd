# The challenge


---
class: left, top

# The challenge

As data analysts, we produce a lot of files

* code 
* figures 
* tables 
* reports 

Organising these files, and **keeping track of different versions** is an important, albeit often unglamorous, part of our job.

# The old school solution


---
class: left, top

# `r emo::ji("bicycle")` The old school solution

The old school solution combines many practical strategies:

* Using file naming conventions to track different file versions 

    * analysis-16jun20.do 
    
    * analysis-16jun20-mh.do 
    
    * analysis-final.do 
    
    * analysis-final-final.do


* Use shared folders, google drive etc 

* Share code and code snippets over email, slack etc

# The new school solution

---
class: left, top

# `r emo::ji("rocket")` The new school solution

The new school solution is to use dedicated **version control software**. 

There are a few options out there but by far the most popular choice is the combination of **Git** + **GitHub** `r fontawesome::fa(name = "github")`.

_Is it worth it?_

---
class: left, top, inverse

# Yes!! It is definitely worth it! 

1. Version control 

1. Collaboration

1. Organisation 

1. Automatic web presence 

1. Great for teaching

1. Powerful search

1. Issue tracking

1. It is all _free_

All of these promote **reproducibility** `r emo::ji('party')` and **transparency** `r emo::ji('stars')`

### A repository is where the magic happens `r emo::ji('wizard')`

* Referred to as a repo 
* Database of changes to your code (aka _diffs_)
* Hidden folder on your system named **.git**

Once you initialise a git repo in a folder, git is ready to start tracking changes to all the files and subfolders therein.

# Frequently asked questions

# Frequently asked questions 

## What files can I track? 

--

This all works best for non-binary or text files e.g. your typical code files (.sas, .do, .R, .Rmd, .py) but also .png, .csv etc

You can include non-binary files (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx etc) in a git repo but the diff features won't work. It can still be useful if using the repo as a central orgnaisation point (e.g. if you save your published manuscript with the analysis code). 


---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

## How often should I commit? 

--

Well, it depends. Just like when you start writing a word document you might not click save very often as you spew out lots of ideas, but at the end of your thesis you will carefully save evey change! 

It is best practice to keep commits fairly small and related, especially for mature projects. 


---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

## What about my sensitive data/code? 

--

If your data are sensitive be very careful not to track with Git (more tips on this later). 

Private repos are available if you don't want the public to see your code (you can change to public later if desired.)

---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

## How does my repo line up with my project folder?

--

Just like when you create project folders and sub-folders you need to put some thought into how to organise your repos.

One option is to initiate the repo in the root folder of the project, meaning that all files and subfolders are tracked by default. 

An alternative would be to initiate the repo in a specific folder, e.g. your `Code` folder, and keep your data in a separate `Data` folder.

In either approach you can specify any files or folders that Git should ignore in a special file named `.gitignore`.

# Exercise 1 of 7 `r emo::ji("weight")`

### Practice using the shell

.left-column[

### Task 
Create a new folder and empty text file using GitBash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)

**Note** Ctrl+V doesn’t work in GitBash, right-click instead. You may need to adjust the settings.

]

.right-column[

1. Open GitBash/Terminal

1. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the location you want to create your new folder

1. Use the `mkdir` command to create a new folder named GitDemo. Enter <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;"> mkdir GitDemo</span>

1. Use the `cd` command again to change directory to the new folder. Enter <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;"> cd GitDemo</span>

1. Use the `touch` command to create a new text file named method.txt. Enter <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;"> touch method.txt</span>

1. Practice the commands `ls` (list) and `pwd` (print working directory)

1. <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;">git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
</span>

To check it has worked you can enter <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;">git config --list
</span> and you should see your user name and email listed among your configuration settings.

# Exercise 3 of 7 `r emo::ji("weight")``r emo::ji("weight")``r emo::ji("weight")`

### Configure git

.left-column[

### Task 
Initialise a git repo then add and commit changes to your file
]

.right-column[

1. Make sure you are in your new folder: <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;">cd GitDemo</span>

1. Initialise a git repo: <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;">git init</span>

1. Check the status of your repo: <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;">git status</span> (You should see that method.txt is untracked)

1. Open method.txt with your preferred text editor & write a short list or recipe. After each item:

    1. Save the file as you usually would

    1. Stage the file: <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;">git add -A</span>

    1. Commit the file: <span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;">git commit -m “your message here”</span>

### Host your repo on GitHub

.left-column[

### Task 
Push your local git repo to a GitHub repo
]

.right-column[

1. Create a new public repo in GitHub (use + button in top right-hand corner)

1. Name it something unique or give it the same name as your project folder.

1. No need to initialize a README, add a .gitignore or license

1. When you are ready select **Create Repository**

1. Follow the instructions to push an existing repository from the command line (copy code into GitBash/Terminal)
You should now be able to explore your history on GitHub

1. Go to your partner’s GitHub repo and click on the clone link to get the HTTP url

1. Using GitBash/Terminal, use `cd` to navigate to a location you want to clone your partners repo (This will create a local copy of their repo. Don’t clone it into your own repo!)

1. Enter `git clone <your partners url>` to clone their repo: for example:
	<span style="font: Courier; color: #F82472;">git clone https://github.com/MarkHanly/GitPrax.git</span>

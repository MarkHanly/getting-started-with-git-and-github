# The challenge

As data analysts, we produce a lot of files

* code 
* figures 
* tables 
* reports 

Organising these files is an important, albeit often unglamorous, part of our job.  

--

*** 

**Managing versions** What do you do with old code? 

**Ensuring reproducibility** Can others reproduce your results? What about your future self? 

**Facilitating collaboration** Can other team members easily contribute?

# The old school solution


---
class: left, top

# `r emo::ji("bicycle")` The old school solution

The old school solution combines many practical strategies:

* Using file naming conventions to track different file versions 

    * analysis-16jun20.do 
    * analysis-16jun20-mh.do 
    * analysis-final.do 
    * analysis-final-final.do

* Note changes directly in code comments or separate documentation

* Use shared folders, google drive etc 

* Share code and code snippets over email, slack etc 

--

*** 
This is ok(ish) for one person working on a small, brief project.

But if the project is **large**, involves **many people** or goes on for a **long time** this approach very quickly breaks down `r emo::ji("worried")`




---
class: left, top

# `r emo::ji("rocket")` The new school solution

The new school solution is to use dedicated **version control software**. 

There are a few options out there but by far the most popular choice is the combination of **Git** + **GitHub** `r fontawesome::fa(name = "github")`.

# Key concept: Repository 

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[

### A repository is where the magic happens `r emo::ji('wizard')`

* Referred to as a repo 
* Database of changes to your code (aka _diffs_)
* Hidden folder on your system named **.git**

Once you initialise a git repo in a folder, git is ready to start tracking changes to all the files and subfolders therein. 

]

# Key concept: Commit 

.pull-left[

![](images/commit-diagram.png)

]

.pull-right[

### Commit

* A Commit is like clicking save in a MS Word document 

* It saves a snapshot of the code at that point in time 

* Why you commit you must write a message explaining what changed

* Committing is a two stage process - more on this later

# Key concept: Diff 

.pull-left[

### Diff

* A diff is the set of changes between two versions of a file 

* When you commit, it is the _diff_ that gets recorded, not the whole version

* The screenshot highlights a single diff: deletion of the word "clinic"

# Frequently asked questions

# Frequently asked questions 

### What files can I track? 

***

--

This all works best for non-binary or text files e.g. your typical code files (.sas, .do, .R, .Rmd, .py) but also .png, .csv etc

You can include non-binary files (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx etc) in a git repo but the diff features won't work. It can still be useful if using the repo as a central orgnaisation point (e.g. if you save your published manuscript with the analysis code). 


---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

### How often should I commit? 

***

--

Well, it depends.

Just like when you start writing a word document you might not click save very often as you spew out lots of ideas, but at the end of your thesis you will carefully save evey change! 

It is best practice to keep commits fairly small and related, especially for mature projects. 


---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

### What's with the staging area? 

***

--

There are advantages of breaking up the commit into two steps 

* You can split a big edit into bite-sized pieces 

* Easier to review

* If you make a mistake you can _unstage_. You can't un-commit!


---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

### What about my sensitive data/code? 

***

--

If your data are sensitive be very careful not to track with Git (more tips on this later). 

Private repos are available if you don't want the public to see your code (you can change to public later if desired.)

---
class: left, top

# Frequently asked questions 

### How does my repo align with my project folder?

***

--

Just like when you create project folders and sub-folders you need to put some thought into how to organise your repos.

One option is to initiate the repo in the root folder of the project, meaning that all files and subfolders are tracked by default. 

An alternative would be to initiate the repo in a specific folder, e.g. your `Code` folder, and keep your data in a separate `Data` folder.

In either approach you can specify any files or folders that Git should ignore in a special file named `.gitignore`.

#### Overview of exercises

* Exercise 1 - 3: Working locally with Git `r emo::ji("car")`

* Exercise 4: Configuring GitHub + Git `r emo::ji("airplane")`

* Exercise 5 - 7: Working with Git and GitHub `r emo::ji("rocket")`

***


#### Tips for Success

* You will be entering commands into Git Bash or the Terminal. **Enter the commands carefully!** **A** versus **a** or **-** versus **--** will make a difference! 

* **Pay attention to any messages** git returns. They're often incomprehensible but will flag if something has gone wrong. 

* Use <span class=myCode>git status</span> often to confirm the current state of your repo. 

* You can use tab in Git Bash/Terminal to auto-complete file and folder names

* `ctrl+V` doesn't work to paste into Git Bash, use `insert` or `Right Click -> Edit -> Paste`

# Exercise 1 of 7 `r emo::ji("weight")`

### Practice using the shell

.left-column[

### Task 
Create a new folder and empty text file using GitBash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)

**Note** Ctrl+V doesn’t work in GitBash, right-click instead. You may need to adjust the settings.

]

.right-column[

1. Open GitBash/Terminal

1. Use the <span class=myCode>cd</span> command (change directory) to navigate to the location you want to create your new folder. If you're not sure where you are pointing <span class=myCode>pwd</span> (print working directory) and <span class=myCode>ls</span> (list) are useful. 

1. Use the `mkdir` command to create a new folder named GitDemo. Enter <span class=myCode>mkdir GitDemo</span>

1. Use the `cd` command again to change directory to the new folder. Enter <span class=myCode> cd GitDemo</span>

1. Use the `touch` command to create a new text file named method.txt. Enter <span class=myCode> touch method.txt</span>

1. Make sure you are in your new folder: <span class=myCode>cd GitDemo</span>

1. Initialise a git repo: <span class=myCode>git init</span>

1. Check the status of your repo: <span class=myCode>git status</span> (You should see that method.txt is untracked)

1. Open method.txt with your preferred text editor & write a short list or recipe. After each item:

    1. Save the file as you usually would

    1. Stage the file: <span class=myCode>git add -A</span>

    1. Commit the file: <span class=myCode>git commit -m “your message here”</span>

1. Enter <span class=myCode>git log</span> to view a log of your changes

Git and Github are powerful tools with numerous features. We have only scraped the surface, focussing on the simplest elements of an individual workflow but the real benefits come with collaboration.

*** 

Collaborating effectively requires additional steps that haven't been covered in these intro slides:

**branching** | spawn a new branch to develop new features

**merging** | combine separate branches back together

**pull requests** | request your feature branch to be integrated into the code base
